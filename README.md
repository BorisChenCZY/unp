# System

The system used to work and run this project is Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit 4.18.0-21.

# The Book
Unix Network Programming Volume 1 (3rd Edition)
by W.Richard Stevens, Bill Fenner, and Andrew M.Rudoff.

I got the copy of such book around 12-15 years ago, but fortunately I still keep it safe until today (year 2019).
Since then, I never finish the entire book, probably just a chapter or two then never get back there again.

Now it's time to actually make use of it (firstly aim to reach chater 11).
